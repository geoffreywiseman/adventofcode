# Day 7

Developed in JS, run in Node.

## Part 1

Part 1 was pretty quick.

## Part 2

Part 2 was harder. I tried to use negative lookaheads for the supernet/hypernet split, which was a bad idea. And I was thrown by JS RegExp matching starting at the end of the last match, skipping overlapping matches.
