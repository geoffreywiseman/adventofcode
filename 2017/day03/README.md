# 2017, Day 3

## Part 1

Well, of course, the first challenge is to be able to figure out the co-ordinates of the Nth element of a spiral without having to lay out each preceding square, since that would be a fairly painful process for a larger number.

I did a little Stack Overflow-ing of the subject, and found some solutions, although none of them truly explained how they were derived, so I went through a somewhat painful process of re-deriving the solution that seemed most legible.  There was a more-efficient version that was less legible, but I couldn't quickly see how it was derived, and I don't like to use code I didn't write and don't completely understand, so ... I left that one.

## Part 2

Phew, this looks like a piece of work on its own. Torn between actually calculating out each value and trying to work out a clever way of deriving it.
