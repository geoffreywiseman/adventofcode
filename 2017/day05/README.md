# 2017, Day 5

# Part One

Looks reasonably simple so far. Sticking with Kotlin for now.

It was simple.

# Part Two

Part two is only marginally harder, finished reasonably quickly. I had to clip the output, because it was too spammy at first and was consuming too much computer power just telling me where it was.

All caught up, now I have to wait for Day 6.
