# Day 7

Tricky.

There are lots of ways to make these solutions simpler by avoiding modeling the problem space completely.

For instance -- part one you could simply find all the names and then find the only name that only appears once.

I didn't do those things. I parsed the tree, I walked the tree to balance.

It ended up being more work than it should have been, but it was interesting anyhow.
