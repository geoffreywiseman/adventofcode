# 2017, Day 18: Duet

## Part 1

Not too bad. Screwed up twice:

- once by seeking "recv" instead of "rcv" and not double-checking that the case was exhaustive.
- once by using an Int for the register and having one overflow

## Part 2

Neat. Threading and blocking. Need to figure out how best to handle that with Kotlin and that requires a sharper mind, so ... tomorrow.
