# Day 11 in Rust

Day 11 in Rust. Felt like this might be computationally intensive, and Rust can be *so fast*.

Went pretty well other than my Rust got a little rusty (pun partially intended) since I last wrote some:
- Started with Arrays but much easier to work with a Vec when you don't know size in advance.
- Little bits about remembering what to make mutable, when to use references, etc. No serious borrow-checker problems, other than just ... getting back used to it.
- No lifetime issues here, which definitely helped.

Definitely ran quickly -- didn't spend any time on performance because was totally unnecessary.

## Tools

I used CLion 2021.3 (after updating), `cargo init` to set up the project, and no external dependencies.
