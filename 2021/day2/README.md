# Day 2 in Kotlin

Dealing with a whole IntelliJ project just for a single day feels like overkill, so I thought I'd refresh my memory on using a Kotlin Script (.kts). 

Still kinda sucks:
- IntelliJ LightEdit mode is half-broken right now -- the menu is constantly flashing and chewing up CPU cycles, half the useful elements of IntelliJ don't work.
- VSCode has good highlights, but I miss completions and warnings almost immediately.
- But if I switch over to a project, then it wants Gradle and source directories and all the stuff that makes a JVM project overkill.

I could, of course, do what the AoC/Kotlin challenge suggests, share one project across all days, but then I'm really locked into Kotlin, and I kinda like having the flexibility of picking whatever language appeals to me for a single day's work. And for that, the structure of a Java or Kotlin project in IntelliJ feels like overkill.

Anyway, it's done.
