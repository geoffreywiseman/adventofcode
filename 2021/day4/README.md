# Day 4 in Go

While I like using Kotlin to solve the problems, I'm a little less enthused with the tooling choices -- either using IntelliJ IDEA with a full-on Maven/Gradle project, which seems like overkill, or using VSCode / IntelliJ LiteIDE which feels like I'm missing half of the things that make writing Kotlin fun.

So today, I wrote the solution Go (golang) using JetBrains Goland.

It went ... ok. 

# Go for Advent of Code

Go has some fine qualities, but I find it a bit verbose for some tasks. Some things that can be expressed pretty compactly in Kotlin, JavaScript, Ruby and occasionally even Rust are much more mechanical in Go. That's one of my complaints about Go, that a good percentage of the code ends up being the mechanics instead of the logic. It's something that I find about both Java and Go code.

Anyway -- I'm not sure I love using Go for Advent of Code, simply because it takes more time to write all those mechanics. In the end, the program might be efficient, and compile quickly, but it can take more time to write the code, which doesn't feel like the right tradeoff for AoC.

That said, Go isn't one of my day-to-day languages right now, so I'm probably a little slower writing code in Go than in some of the other languages anyway.
