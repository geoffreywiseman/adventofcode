# Day 9, in JavaScript

Not bad. Reminded me of a few rough edges on JavaScript, for me at least, like:
- Bad default for `sort()` comparator
- No `take(N)` equivalent
- No `sum` equivalent

Yes, they're all easy to work around, but ... they're so common, make them easy?

Anyway. Was relatively painless.  I was worried that there were going to be weird cases with local minimums where two basis might meet, but the description of the puzzle suggested that that wasn't going to be true.

# Tools

WebStorm again, Node v17, no dependencies.
